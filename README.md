## 💫 The Motivation:
A new report published by UNICEF and WaterAid found that more than a third of girls in South Asia miss school during their periods, mainly due to a lack of access to toilets and pads in schools and no proper education about menstruation. The UN has recognized menstrual hygiene as a global public health and human rights issue, globally 1.2 billion women lack access to basic sanitation and hygiene. So we decided to end the Period-Poverty and long-run stigma by educating girls and providing healthcare facilities to them.

## 💫 How it Works :
We are revolutionizing women's healthcare by providing personalized feedback, comprehensive analysis, and period cycle tracking, addressing the insecurities and social stigma that often deter women from seeking help. Our platform offers a secure and supportive environment where women can access their MRI scan results and find the nearest hospitals and gynecologists for their medical needs. With MRI scans, users can easily detect and manage PCOD/PCOS, common conditions affecting many young women.
In addition, our platform features a blog section where She Winners can share their stories and raise awareness about societal stereotypes. This space empowers women to showcase their knowledge and inspire others, fostering a community where each girl can make a meaningful impact on society. Join us in transforming women's healthcare and breaking down barriers for a healthier, more informed future.<br><br>
🌟Data Collection and Preparation: We used a publicly available dataset mentioned above containing 234 ultrasound images with 1363 labels, images are labeled into two classes: "PCOS" and "No PCOS." The dataset was split into training and testing sets to ensure robust model evaluation.<br><br>
🌟Model Selection: We chose YOLOv8 for its superior performance in object detection tasks. YOLOv8x architecture allows for real-time detection and classification, making it ideal for medical image analysis.<br><br>
🌟Training the Model: The training process involved feeding the labeled ultrasound images into the YOLOv8 model. We applied various data augmentation techniques to enhance the model's generalization capabilities and prevent overfitting.<br><br>
🌟Evaluation and Testing: After training, the model was evaluated on the test set to assess its accuracy, precision, recall, and overall performance. Fine-tuning was performed to optimize the model further. Achieved a test accuracy of 90%.<br><br>
🌟Deployment: The trained model was then integrated into a user-friendly application, allowing healthcare professionals to upload ultrasound images and receive instant diagnostic results.<br><br>

4. Step up the models by running them in Google Colab

5.Run the Flask_Server before that add you auth key for ngrok and use the public url 
  and update it in the ML_dijango\myproject\myapp\views.py file

 6. After all steps defined above you can run command `npm start` to run application at `localhost:5000`.

 7.In the terminal start the Djanog server
```sh
python manage.py runserver

```
