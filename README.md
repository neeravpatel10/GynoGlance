## The motivation:
A new report published by UNICEF and WaterAid found that more than a third of girls in South Asia miss school during their periods, mainly due to a lack of access to toilets and pads in schools and no proper education about menstruation. The UN has recognized menstrual hygiene as a global public health and human rights issue, globally 1.2 billion women lack access to basic sanitation and hygiene. So we decided to end the Period-Poverty and long-run stigma by educating girls and providing healthcare facilities to them.



## How it works :

  We have here to modernized our women healthcare system by providing the personalized feedbacks, analysis, mood tracking, period cycle traking to  women, who hesitate because of their insecurities and long run social stigma.
  Through our platform she can `Track her Period Cycle`,  Get her `Mood Analysis` and she will also get to access the nearest hospitals and gynaecologists for their medical problems. Through our platform only user can `Schedule Appointments` with doctors and get consultancy at home only.
